### Project Description
Confuse Me is a quirky, browser-based web app filled with fun but senseless challenges like reverse word typing, endless maze walking, and colour-click confusion. It’s built purely for laughter and a bit of brain-melting chaos.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Life makes too much sense. The world is full of purposeful tools and useful websites. But where’s the confusion? Where’s the chaos? Where’s the web app that just wastes your time?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built a beautifully pointless website that reverses your input, loops you forever in a maze, challenges your instincts with misleading colors, and plays with your expectations in every possible way.

Reverse Word Tool – You type something, it shows you the flipped version. Useless but addictive.
